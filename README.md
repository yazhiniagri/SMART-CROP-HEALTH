# SMART-CROP-HEALTH
“This project explores the incidence of root rot disease in groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) under different sowing dates. It analyzes how sowing time influences disease occurrence and severity, providing data, statistical insights, and management perspectives for crop protection.”
3. Description
This project explores the incidence of *root rot disease in groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.)* under different sowing dates and data sources.  
It analyzes how soil parameters, climatic conditions, and crop practices influence disease occurrence and severity.  
The project provides data insights, visualizations, and management perspectives for sustainable crop protection.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify key factors influencing root rot incidence.  
- Integrate soil, climate, and crop management data for disease inference.  
- Provide visualizations and dashboards for better decision-making.

## 📊 Dataset
- Field disease severity observations  
- Crop management practices
- Different date of sowing
- disease incidence

## 🔬 Methodology
1. Data collection from multiple sources  
2. Data cleaning & preprocessing  
3. Statistical analysis & correlations  
4. Visualization (Excel ) 
5. Inference & findings

## 📈 Results
- High soil moisture and temperature strongly influenced disease severity.  
- Late sowing increased disease occurrence.  
- Multi-source integration improved inference accuracy compared to single-source analysis.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (Dashboards, Pivot tables)  

## ✅ Conclusion & Future Scope
- Data-driven approaches enhance crop disease management.  
- Future scope: AI/ML-based prediction models and remote sensing integration.
